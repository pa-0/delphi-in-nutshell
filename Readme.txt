Run the setup program to copy all the source code examples to your hard
drive. All the source files are copied to a single directory tree and
organized in one project group (Nutshell.bpg). With two exceptions, the
setup program performs a simple copy of the source files. The exceptions
are the cltn50.bpl and nutshl50.bpl runtime packages: the setup program
modifies the project options so when you build the packages, the .BPL
files are stored in your Windows system directory so Windows can easily
find and load the runtime packages.

After installing the source code, open Nutshell.bpg in Delphi and away
you go. Start by building all the projects, and if you want to use the
TTile component, you can install the Nut50.bpl design-time package. 

Note that the downloaded source code might differ from some of the
examples in the book. The printed examples are often simplified to
highlight an important point, but the downloaded source code contains
the full complexity of a working project.
